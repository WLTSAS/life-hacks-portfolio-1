            <h2>Banana Hacks</h2>
                <p>These hacks are going to be filled with fruit love, so lets slow down the ripening process of our Bananas by 
                    wrapping a piece of plastic  cling wrap around the crown of the banana bunch (the part where all the stems connect)
                    which in turn gives us a longer life. The same can be said about leaving them in a paper bag that can actually speed
                    up the rippening process.</p>

                <h2>Strawberry Hacks</h2>
                <p>Yet again we have another fruit hack larking in the shadows awaiting its turn for fruit glory,
                    this time around the process will be completely different by using vinegar which is known for its  antibacterial properties,
                    The method goes as such, soak your berries for 5 mins in a mixture of vinegar and water, next rinse your berrries and let them
                    dry before storing them in the fridge. Boom! you've just increased the life span of your fruit friends.
